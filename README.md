# How to Use Github
by Naomi

Welcome! Although I may not be the best source out there for all of your GitHub needs, I figured it would be helpful to make a straightforward how to guide for new Harvard Forest users out there. There are plenty of sites that will walk you through this too, but they tend to be wordy and honestly, pretty boring. Hopefully I do a decent job at spicing things up and being straight to the point.

# What even is GitHub?
GitHub is a useful tool to share and collaborate with others on code. It also tracks and saves changes to your code files, making it easy to go back and see what edits have been made, when they were made, and by who. It's like the "See Changes" function in Google Drive, but for code. 

# How do I use GitHub?
Technically, you can use GitHub through the command line, but I honestly never really got the hang of that. The easier, more user-friendly way to use GitHub is through GitHub Desktop. 

GitHub Desktop looks like this:
