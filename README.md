# How to Use Github
by Naomi

Welcome! Although I may not be the best source out there for all of your GitHub needs, I figured it would be helpful to make a straightforward how to guide for all of our new Harvard Forest users out there. There are plenty of sites that will walk you through this too, but they tend to be wordy and honestly, pretty boring. Hopefully I do a decent job at spicing things up and being straight to the point. 

Still have questions after reading this? Feel free to email me at nhegwood@college.harvard.edu or come find me! 

# What even is GitHub?
GitHub is a useful tool to share and collaborate with others on code. It also tracks and saves changes to your code files, making it easy to go back and see what edits have been made, when they were made, and by who. It's like the "See Changes" function in Google Drive, but for code. 

# How do I use GitHub?
Technically, you can use GitHub through the command line, but I honestly never really got the hang of that. The easier, more user-friendly way to use GitHub is through GitHub Desktop. 

GitHub Desktop looks like this:

In the top left corner, it says your current repository. **Repositories** are basically folders of code files, just like a folder you may have on your desktop. You can make a repository by going to GitHub on a web browser, going to the organization you want to make it under, and finding the "Make Repository" button. You are actually in a repository right now if you are reading this guide off of GitHub! 

To the left of your current repository is your branch. **Branches** are a little complicated, but I will do my best here. In short, branches allow users to work on code without other users edits. Branches always need to be merged back to the main branch eventually. The biggest downside is that if you merge back to the main branch and someone else has made edits to the file on the main branch, you have to deal with conflicting edits. I have only worked on the main branch because I usually work on code by myself, but branches can be helpful to use if many people are working on code. If you are interested in using branches, feel free to ask me or look here: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches 

Underneath the Current Repository section are files with edits that are waiting to be uploaded onto GitHub. You can click on a file to view it and the edits that were made. For example, if I click on Lambir_statistics_2022, this pops up:

I believe I may have deleted this file and started from scratch or I may have moved the file to a different folder. The red areas (in this case all of the lines) are lines that have been deleted. In cases where lines were added, they will be highlighted green.

To upload one of these files, first select the box to the left of the desired file name. The box will green with a checkmark in it once it is selected. Then navigate to the box below the file names. In the area that says "summary (required)" enter a summary of the edits. This should be fairly short like "minor edits" or "added blank calculation." If you have more details to add, you can add them in the description box. Once you are ready, you can press commit to blank (in this case, it says "commit to main" because I am on the main branch). Once committed, you have to push the files, which is basically uploading them to GitHub. To do so, click the button next to the current branch label on the top. On my screenshot, it currently says fetch origin, but in practice it will say push.

At the start of each coding session, it is best practice to go to GitHub desktop and **pull** your files. This means that the files on your desktop will be updated with the latest version that is on GitHub. So, if your RA coded while you were away, you can see their updated code right away. This also helps prevent two different versions of the same code file from existing, which will save you a headache later on. To pull, go to GitHub desktop and press the button that on my screen says "fetch origin." This is the same button used to push changes. If there is anything to pull, it will often say pull. 

# This is all great Naomi, but how to I even set up GitHub Desktop??
To be honest, I don't remember, but will write this section once I figure it out myself oops
